# Genisys Musicbot

## Description

Genisys MusicBot is a simple and fun bot that can play music from YouTube on your Discord server.
It uses Discord.js, Discord-player, ytdl and ffmpeg to stream audio and handle commands.
You can search for songs by name, URL or playlist, control the playback with basic commands like play, pause, skip, queue and volume, and enjoy some cool features like search and bassboost.

This project was created as a hobby and may or may not be maintained in the future. Feel free to fork it, modify it or contribute to it if you find it useful or interesting.

Currently the only supported language for the bot is German
